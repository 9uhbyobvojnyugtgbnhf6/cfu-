  <h3>Hobbies and fun things that i like to do:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Swimming. Swimming is pretty fun because you get to do relay races with people and you can add it for your survival</li>
    <li>Video Games. I feel like I don't have to explain this one to all those Gen Z people out there.</li>
    <li>Baths. I used to love baths, until I lost that privilege because my skin got extremely bad. It used to make me feel very relaxed and calm, though.</li>
    <li>Making Money. I cant make money</li>
